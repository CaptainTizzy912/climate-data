# Climate Data Analysis: EDA & Regression

## Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modeling on climate data.
The goal is to understand data distributions, check relationships between variables, and build interpretable regression models.

## Dataset
520 observations with the following columns:
- Temperature (°C)
- Precipitation (mm)
- Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (m/s)
- Atmospheric Pressure (hPa)
- CO₂ Concentration (ppm)
- Region
- Month

## Analysis Workflow
- Data cleaning and quality check
- Exploratory data analysis
- Normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk)
- Feature transformation
- Correlation and influence analysis
- Linear regression modeling
- Interpretation of results

## Key Insights
- Precipitation is non-normally distributed
- Region has a strong influence on climate patterns
- Atmospheric pressure negatively impacts temperature
- CO₂ concentration shows weak short-term influence
- Regression model provides interpretable insights
